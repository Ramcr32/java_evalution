Q1) Explain the difference between IS-A and Has-A relationship with the help of an
example and explain about access modifiers and their accessibility?

ans:- IS-A relation ship build between parent class and child class, inheritance occure IS-A relation ship
	it is known a inheritance relationship. it is used for code reusability.
	ex- 
	class a{
	}
	class b extends a{
	public static void main(String [] args){
		a name = new b;  //it is called IS-A relationship
	}
	}
	
	HAS-A relationship also used for code reusability. it is also composition relationship it is having 
	between same level class.
	class a{
	}
	class b extends a{
	a name; //HAS-A relationship
	public static void main(String [] args){
		
	}
	}
	
	in java we have 4 access modifier:
	1) public
	2) protected
	3)default
	4)private
